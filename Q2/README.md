# Task 2 â€“ Interactive To-Do List with Priority Management

I implemented this task by developing an interactive to-do list where users can add tasks with a specific priority (High, Medium, or Low). Tasks are dynamically displayed using the `map()` function and grouped by their priority levels. I also used event delegation to handle clicks for completing, deleting, and undoing tasks.

I further enhanced the application by using `reduce()` to calculate the total number of incomplete tasks. For extra functionality, I added a search/filter feature and a dark mode toggle to improve usability.

## Files:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

## How to Run:

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Add new tasks by entering a task name and selecting a priority.
3. Use the provided buttons to mark tasks as complete, delete them, or undo completions.
4. Utilize the search/filter input to quickly find tasks.
5. Toggle dark mode as needed.
