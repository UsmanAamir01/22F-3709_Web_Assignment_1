# Task 1 – Unique Product Card Design

I implemented this task by creating a visually appealing product card with a 3D flip animation. The card has two sides: the front displays the product name, price, and image, while the back shows a short product description. I dynamically generated the card content from a JavaScript object and used CSS Grid for proper layout.

To enhance the user experience, I added a bonus "Buy Now" button that logs the product’s name to the console when clicked, as well as a dark mode toggle that lets users switch themes seamlessly.

## Files:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

## How to Run:

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Hover over the product cards to see the 3D flip effect.
3. Click the "Buy Now" button to view the product name in the console.
4. Use the dark mode toggle to switch between light and dark themes.
